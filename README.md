# materials_thesis
This repository manages materials used for experimental studies of my Ph.D. thesis.

## Chapter1
You can create Figures 1.1 and 1.2 from materials in this folder.

## Chapter3
You can create Figures 3.2 and 3.3 from materials in this folder, but please note the followings. 

- You need [cit-HepTh.txt](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.html) and [cit-Patents.txt](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-Patents.html) as input.
- You cannot perfectly reproduce these Figures because experimental studies in Chapter3 include stochastic process. 

## Chapter4
You can create Figures 4.2 and 4.3 from materials in this folder, but please note the followings.

- You need [web-Google.txt](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.html) as input.
